When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote directory would be useful when working on a project with a team of other develoeprs.
Each developer could access the past commits and work independently; later the commits can be merged.
As a cloud service, working with a remote repository allows one to work on the same project from multiple computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want two separate versions of the project. The local version could serve as a
backup for the remote repository. Also, if the remote repository automatically
pulled into the local branch, a bug could be introduced.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of a Github repository that stores the new repository in your
Github account. A clone is a copy of a Github or local repository that is stored
on the local machine. Branches are a new line of commits that are used when testing
new features. Branches can be merged back into the master.
