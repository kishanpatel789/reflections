What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Upon initialization, a .git directory is created which tracks changes to all files
added to the repository. Without initializing, the changes will not be tracked.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary directory where files are collected for a single commit.
Having a staging area allows the user to make sure that they have properly selected
the files they want to include in a particular commit.
